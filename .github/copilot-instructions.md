Project: webstability - Landing page template

This repository is a Vite + React + TypeScript landing page focused on simple website subscriptions for entrepreneurs. Keep components small, accessible, responsive, and performant. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations and lucide-style icons.

Guidance for Copilot:
- Follow existing conventions and TypeScript types.
- Prioritize accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA where needed).
- Keep CSS in Tailwind utility classes by default; extract reusable classes into components.
- Use mock API route /api/check for domain availability checks.
- Do not add large media files; use SVG where possible.
