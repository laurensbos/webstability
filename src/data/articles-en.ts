## How much does a website cost in 2025?

As an entrepreneur, a professional website is essential for your online visibility. But what does it actually cost? In this article, we give you a complete overview.

### The smartest option: website subscription

## Getting a website made: 10 tips to make the best choice

Choosing the right partner to build your website is an important decision. With these 10 tips, you'll make the best choice.

### 1. Review the portfolio critically

Don't just ask for examples, also check:
- Are the websites still online?
- Do they load quickly?
- Do they work well on mobile?

### 2. Ask for references

Call or email at least two previous clients. Ask about:
- The collaboration
- Whether deadlines were met
- How problems were solved

### 3. Understand what you're getting

Make sure you know exactly what's included:
- How many pages?
- Including content/texts?
- Mobile responsive?
- Basic SEO?

### 4. Check ownership rights

Important question: who owns the website after delivery? Watch out for:
- Can you move the website?
- Do you get all source files?
- What happens at termination?

### 5. Ask about maintenance

A website needs regular maintenance:
- What does maintenance cost per month/year?
- What's included?
- How quickly are problems solved?

### 6. Watch for hidden costs

Ask explicitly about:
- Hosting costs
- SSL certificate
- Email hosting
- Future modifications

### 7. Choose responsive design

More than 60% of your visitors come via mobile. Test whether previous websites work well on phone and tablet.

### 8. Ask about the technology

What system (CMS) is used? Popular options:
- WordPress (flexible, many plugins)
- Webflow (modern, fast)
- Custom (expensive, but tailored)

### 9. Set a clear schedule

Make concrete agreements about:
- Start date
- Feedback moments
- Delivery date
- What if there's a delay?

### 10. Compare multiple quotes

Request at least 3 quotes and compare on:
- Price-quality ratio
- What's included/excluded?
- Feeling about the collaboration

### Conclusion

Take your time to choose. A good website is an investment that pays off in more customers and professionalism. When in doubt, choose a partner with transparent pricing and clear agreements - like a website subscription.

## SEO for beginners: ranking higher in Google

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the art of being found in Google. In this guide, we explain the basics without technical jargon.

### What is SEO?

SEO means search engine optimization. The goal: optimize your website so Google shows you higher in search results. The higher you rank, the more visitors you get.

### The 3 pillars of SEO

**1. Technical SEO**
This is about how your website is built:
- Fast loading time
- Mobile-friendly
- Secure (HTTPS)
- Structured data

**2. Content SEO**
This is about what's on your website:
- Relevant texts
- Good headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Images with alt text
- Internal links

**3. Off-page SEO**
This is about signals from outside:
- Links from other websites
- Social media signals
- Reviews and mentions

### 10 SEO tips you can apply today

1. **Choose the right keywords**
   Think about what your customers search for. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner.

2. **Write unique titles**
   Each page needs a unique, descriptive title (max 60 characters).

3. **Optimize your meta descriptions**
   This is the text snippet under your title in Google (max 155 characters).

4. **Use headings smartly**
   One H1 per page, then H2s and H3s for structure.

5. **Make your website fast**
   Compress images, use caching, choose good hosting.

6. **Ensure mobile version**
   Google looks at your mobile site first (mobile-first indexing).

7. **Write for people, not for Google**
   Good content for visitors is also good for SEO.

8. **Build internal links**
   Link to relevant pages on your own website.

9. **Get backlinks**
   Links from other websites are a strong signal for Google.

10. **Stay consistent**
    SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Keep adding content regularly.

### How long does it take?

You won't see SEO results immediately. Expect:
- 3-6 months for initial improvements
- 6-12 months for significant results
- Ongoing optimization for lasting success

### Tools that help

- **Google Search Console** (free) - See how Google sees your site
- **Google Analytics** (free) - Measure your visitors
- **Yoast SEO** (WordPress plugin) - Helps with on-page SEO

### Conclusion

SEO doesn't have to be difficult. Start with the basics: good content, fast website, mobile-friendly. The rest follows naturally. At Webstability, all websites come with standard SEO optimization.

## Website vs Social Media: what does your business need?

"I have an Instagram, do I still need a website?" We hear this question often. The short answer: yes. Read the long answer here.

### Why social media alone isn't enough

**1. You depend on the platform**
Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok can change their rules overnight. Or disappear. You have no control.

**2. Your reach is limited**
Organic reach on social media has dropped to 2-5%. Of your 1000 followers, only 20-50 see your post.

**3. You're building on someone else's property**
Every post, every video, every message - you're putting energy into something that isn't yours.

### What your website does offer

- **Ownership** - Your website is yours
- **Full control** - You decide how it looks
- **SEO benefits** - Being found in Google
- **Professionalism** - Your own domain radiates trust
- **No algorithm** - Visitors always see all content

### The ideal combination

The best strategy combines both:

**Website = your home base**
This is where all important information lives. This is where people come to learn more and take action.

**Social media = your marketing**
This is where you attract attention, build relationships, and direct people to your website.

### Practical example

1. You post a tip on Instagram
2. Your bio contains a link to your website
3. On your website, people can:
   - Read more tips (blog)
   - View your services
   - Contact you
   - Make a purchase

### How much time does it take?

**Website**: 1-2 hours per month for small updates
**Social media**: 2-5 hours per week for content

With a website subscription, you spend even less time on your website because we handle the maintenance.

### Conclusion

Think of social media as the flyer you hand out, and your website as the store where people come in. You need both, but your website is the foundation.

## Why a fast website is crucial for your business

In a world where everything needs to be fast, a slow website is a killer for your business. Research shows that every second of delay reduces your conversion by 7%.

### The facts about website speed

- **53%** of mobile users leave a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load
- **1 second** delay = **7%** fewer conversions
- Google uses speed as a **ranking factor**
- **79%** of dissatisfied visitors never return

### What makes a website slow?

**1. Large images**
Non-optimized photos are the biggest culprit. A 5MB photo can slow down your site by seconds.

**2. Too many plugins**
Each plugin adds code. The more plugins, the slower.

**3. Poor hosting**
Cheap shared hosting places hundreds of sites on one server.

**4. No caching**
Without caching, your site loads completely fresh every time.

**5. External scripts**
Chat widgets, analytics, social media buttons - they all load external code.

### How to test your speed?

Use free tools:
- **Google PageSpeed Insights** - Gives score and tips
- **GTmetrix** - Detailed analysis
- **WebPageTest** - Test from different locations

Aim for:
- Load time: under 3 seconds
- PageSpeed score: above 80

### 7 tips for a faster website

1. **Optimize images** - Use WebP format, compress
2. **Choose good hosting** - Invest in fast, reliable hosting
3. **Use caching** - Browser and server caching
4. **Minimize plugins** - Only what you really need
5. **Lazy loading** - Load images only when they come into view
6. **Use CDN** - Content Delivery Network for faster delivery
7. **Optimize code** - Minify CSS and JavaScript

### At Webstability

All our websites score 90+ on PageSpeed. We use:
- Optimized images
- Fast European hosting
- Modern, clean code
- CDN for fast delivery

### Conclusion

A fast website is not a luxury, but a necessity. It affects your visitors, your conversion, and your Google ranking. Invest in speed - it pays off.

## SSL certificate: what is it and why do you need it?

You've probably seen the padlock in your browser. Or the letters HTTPS before a web address. That's SSL. But what exactly is it and why is it so important?

### What is SSL?

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It's a security protocol that encrypts the connection between your website and the visitor.

Simply put: when someone visits your website, SSL ensures that no one can eavesdrop on what's being sent.

### Why is SSL important?

**1. Security**
Without SSL, hackers can intercept data. Think of:
- Contact forms
- Login credentials
- Payment information

**2. Trust**
Visitors see the padlock and know your site is secure. Without the padlock, Chrome even shows "Not secure".

**3. SEO**
Google gives HTTPS websites a higher ranking than HTTP sites.

**4. Legal**
With GDPR, you're required to protect personal data. SSL is part of that.

### HTTP vs HTTPS

- **HTTP** = unsecured connection
- **HTTPS** = secured connection (with SSL)

### How to recognize SSL?

- The web address starts with **https://** (not http://)
- There's a **padlock** before the address
- Clicking on the padlock shows certificate info

### How much does SSL cost?

- **Free**: Let's Encrypt (included with most hosting)
- **Paid**: €50-€200 per year for extended certificates
- **At Webstability**: Free included with every subscription

### How do I get SSL?

1. **From your hosting provider**: Many offer free Let's Encrypt
2. **Install yourself**: Technical, not recommended
3. **Through your web designer**: Should be standard with every new website

### Frequently asked questions

**My site has no contact form, do I need SSL?**
Yes! Google ranks sites without SSL lower and browsers show warnings.

**Does SSL work on all pages?**
Yes, an SSL certificate secures your entire domain.

**Can SSL slow down my website?**
Used to, but now barely noticeable. The benefits outweigh it.

### Conclusion

SSL is no longer optional in 2025, but a must. It protects your visitors, increases your Google ranking, and radiates professionalism. No SSL = no professional website.

## Writing website copy that converts

Your website can look beautiful, but without good copy, results will be lacking. In this article, you'll learn how to write copy that converts visitors into customers.

### The purpose of website copy

Website copy has one goal: lead the visitor to action. Whether that's:
- Getting in touch
- Buying something
- Signing up
- Reading more

### The basics: know your audience

Before you start writing, answer these questions:
- Who is my ideal customer?
- What problem do they have?
- How do I solve it?
- Why should they choose me?

### Writing for the web

**1. People scan, they don't read**
- Use short paragraphs (max 3-4 sentences)
- Use headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points
- Make important words **bold**

**2. Start with the most important thing**
Online you have 3 seconds to grab attention. Put the essence at the top.

**3. Write in conversational language**
Avoid jargon. Write as you speak.

### The perfect homepage structure

1. **Headline**: What do you do and for whom?
2. **Subheadline**: What result do you deliver?
3. **Social proof**: Customers, reviews, numbers
4. **Benefits**: What do they get?
5. **How it works**: Make it easy
6. **Call-to-action**: What should they do now?

### Writing tips that work

**Address the customer with "you"**
Not: "We offer solutions"
But: "You get a professional website"

**Focus on benefits, not features**
Not: "Website with CMS"
But: "Update your website yourself, whenever you want"

**Use active sentences**
Not: "A website is built by us"
But: "We build your website"

**Be specific**
Not: "Fast delivery"
But: "Your website live within 2 weeks"

### The perfect Call-to-Action (CTA)

A CTA must:
- Stand out (button, color)
- Be clear ("Start now", not "Click here")
- Have urgency ("Request today")
- Be low-threshold ("Free consultation")

### Common mistakes

1. Talking too much about yourself ("We are..." "Our team...")
2. Using jargon
3. Too long sentences
4. No clear call-to-action
5. Copying competitors

### Conclusion

Good website copy takes time but yields a lot. Start simple, test what works, and optimize. Or leave the writing to professionals - at Webstability, we're happy to help.

## Mobile-first design: why your website must be perfect on mobile

In 2025, more than 60% of all website visits come from a mobile device. If your website doesn't work optimally on phone and tablet, you're losing customers.

### The numbers speak

- **61%** of website visits are mobile
- **57%** of users don't recommend a business with a bad mobile site
- **53%** leave sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load
- Google uses **mobile-first indexing**

### What is mobile-first design?

Mobile-first means you design for mobile first, then expand to desktop. This is the opposite of the old approach where mobile was a "shrunk desktop".

### Responsive vs Mobile-first

**Responsive design**: Desktop first, then adapt for mobile
**Mobile-first design**: Mobile first, then expand for desktop

Mobile-first is better because:
- You focus on essential content
- No unnecessary elements
- Better performance
- Better user experience

### Checklist for a good mobile website

**Navigation**
- [ ] Hamburger menu (3 lines)
- [ ] Easy to tap with thumb
- [ ] Not too many menu items

**Text**
- [ ] Font size at least 16px
- [ ] Short paragraphs
- [ ] Sufficient contrast

**Buttons**
- [ ] At least 44x44 pixels
- [ ] Not too close together
- [ ] Clear text

**Forms**
- [ ] As few fields as possible
- [ ] Correct keyboard types (email, phone)
- [ ] Autofill support

**Media**
- [ ] Images scale with screen
- [ ] Videos work without Flash
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

### Common mistakes

1. **Text too small** - Pinching to read is annoying
2. **Buttons too small** - "Fat finger" problem
3. **Pop-ups** - Block the entire screen
4. **Horizontal scrolling** - Big no-go
5. **Slow loading time** - Mobile internet is slower

### How to test your mobile site?

1. **Real phone**: Test on your own phone
2. **Chrome DevTools**: Press F12, click on mobile icon
3. **Google Mobile Test**: search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

### At Webstability

All our websites are built mobile-first. We test on:
- iPhone (different models)
- Android phones
- iPad and Android tablets
- Different browsers

### Conclusion

A mobile-friendly website is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. Start with mobile-first and your customers will thank you.

## Choosing the perfect domain name: complete guide

Your domain name is your digital address. It's often the first thing people see of your brand. A good choice can help you for years; a bad choice can haunt you.

### What is a domain name?

A domain name is the address people type in their browser to visit your website, for example: webstability.com

A domain consists of:
- **Name**: webstability
- **Extension**: .com, .nl, .eu, etc.

### Tips for the perfect domain name

**1. Keep it short**
- Easier to remember
- Fewer typos
- Better on business cards
- Aim for max 15 characters

**2. Make it easy to spell**
Avoid:
- Double letters (glasss.com)
- Numbers (company123.com)
- Hyphens (my-company.com)
- Difficult words

**3. Choose the right extension**

| Extension | Best for |
|-----------|----------|
| .com | International businesses |
| .nl | Dutch businesses |
| .eu | European businesses |
| .shop | Webshops |
| .tech | Tech companies |

**4. Use your company name**
If possible, choose your own company or brand name. This is best for branding.

**5. Think about SEO**
A keyword in your domain can help, but isn't essential. "bakery-amsterdam.com" is clear, but "jansen-bread.com" can work just as well.

### What to avoid

- **Trademark infringement**: Check if the name isn't protected
- **Too specific**: "iphonecasesamsterdam.com" is too limited
- **Trends**: What's hip now can be dated tomorrow
- **Difficult spelling**: photo vs foto

### Where to buy a domain?

Popular domain registrars:
- **GoDaddy** - International
- **Namecheap** - Affordable
- **Google Domains** - Simple
- **Cloudflare** - Great for developers

Costs: $10-$20 per year for .com

### What if your desired domain is taken?

1. **Different extension**: .com taken? Try .io or .co
2. **Add a word**: get[company].com or [company]hq.com
3. **Different spelling**: But be careful of confusion
4. **Contact owner**: Sometimes a domain is for sale
5. **Different name**: Start over

### Check before you buy

- [ ] Domain available?
- [ ] Social media handles free? (@company)
- [ ] No trademark issues?
- [ ] Easy to pronounce?
- [ ] No weird meaning in other languages?

### At Webstability

With our website subscriptions, we're happy to help with:
- Domain name advice
- Domain registration
- Domain forwarding

## Optimizing Google Business Profile for local visibility

As a local entrepreneur, you want to be found by customers in your area. Google Business Profile is essential for that. Here's how to optimize it.

### What is Google Business Profile?

Google Business Profile is Google's free business listing. You see it in:
- Google Search results (on the right)
- Google Maps
- Google on your phone

### Why is it important?

- **46%** of all Google searches are locally oriented
- **76%** of people who search locally visit a business within 24 hours
- **28%** of local searches lead to a purchase
- It's **100% free**

### Step 1: Claim your profile

1. Go to google.com/business
2. Search for your business or create a new one
3. Verify your business (usually by mail)

### Step 2: Fill in everything

**Basic information**
- Correct business name
- Address (or service area)
- Phone number
- Website
- Opening hours

**Categories**
- Choose your primary category carefully
- Add secondary categories
- Be specific: "Italian restaurant", not "Restaurant"

**Description**
- Max 750 characters
- Describe what you do
- Use relevant keywords
- No links or offers

### Step 3: Add photos

Profiles with photos get:
- **42%** more directions requests
- **35%** more website clicks

Add:
- Logo
- Cover photo
- Photos of your location
- Products/services
- Team photos

### Step 4: Collect reviews

Reviews are crucial for local SEO:
- Ask satisfied customers for a review
- Respond to all reviews (including negative ones)
- Respond professionally and quickly
- Thank for positive reviews

### Step 5: Stay active

Google rewards active profiles:
- Post regular updates
- Add new photos
- Answer questions
- Keep information up-to-date

### Creating posts

Use Google Posts for:
- Offers
- Events
- Updates
- New products

Tips:
- Always add an image
- Keep text short (150-300 characters)
- Add a call-to-action
- Post at least once a week

### Common mistakes

1. **Inconsistent NAP** - Name, Address, Phone everywhere the same
2. **Not asking for reviews** - Actively asking yields more reviews
3. **Not responding** - Unanswered questions are a bad signal
4. **Outdated info** - Check opening hours regularly
5. **No posts** - Inactive profiles drop in ranking

### Combine with your website

The power is in the combination:
- Link your website in your profile
- Add local keywords to your website
- Embed Google Maps on your contact page
- Ensure consistent NAP data

### Conclusion

Google Business Profile is free and powerful. Invest time in optimization and you'll be rewarded with more local visibility. At Webstability, we're happy to help with the integration between your website and Google profile.

## Conversion optimization: more customers from the same visitors

You have visitors on your website, but they're not getting in touch. Sound familiar? With conversion optimization (CRO), you get more results from your current visitors.

### What is conversion optimization?

Conversion optimization is the process of improving your website to convert more visitors into customers. A conversion can be:
- Getting in touch
- Requesting a quote
- Making a purchase
- Newsletter signup

### The most important CRO principles

**1. Clear call-to-actions**
Your visitor should immediately see what you expect from them. Use prominent buttons with active texts like "Request quote" instead of "Submit".

**2. Social proof**
Reviews, testimonials, and client logos build trust. People like to do what others do.

**3. Urgency and scarcity**
Limited availability or temporary offers motivate action. But don't overdo it - it must be authentic.

**4. Less choice stress**
Too many options cause decision anxiety. Limit choices and guide the visitor to the best option.

### Practical improvements

- Place your main CTA above the fold
- Use white space to focus attention
- Add trust badges (SSL, reviews, certifications)
- Make forms as short as possible
- Test different button colors and texts

### Measure your results

Without data, you're blind. Use Google Analytics to measure:
- How many visitors you have
- Where they come from
- Which pages they visit
- Where they drop off

### Conclusion

Conversion optimization doesn't have to be complicated. Start with the basics: clear CTAs, social proof, and simple forms. Test, measure, and improve.

## Website trends 2025: what visitors expect

Website visitors' expectations are constantly changing. What was modern in 2020 is now dated. These are the trends for 2025.

### 1. AI-powered experiences

AI is here to stay. Think of:
- Chatbots that really help
- Personalized content
- Smart search functions
- Automatic translations

### 2. Dark mode as standard

More and more visitors use dark mode. A good website offers both options:
- Light mode for daytime
- Dark mode for evening
- Automatic detection of system settings

### 3. Micro-interactions

Small animations bring your website to life:
- Hover effects on buttons
- Loading animations
- Scroll-based animations
- Feedback on actions

### 4. Accessibility first

Accessibility is no longer optional:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Good color contrasts
- Readable font sizes

### 5. Speed is crucial

Core Web Vitals are more important than ever:
- LCP under 2.5 seconds
- FID under 100ms
- CLS under 0.1

### 6. Mobile-first (still!)

65%+ of all visits are mobile. Your website must:
- Be touch-friendly
- Load fast on 4G
- Work without hover states

### 7. Privacy & trust

After GDPR, visitors are more critical:
- Minimal cookies
- Clear privacy policy
- Transparent data collection

### Conclusion

The trends of 2025 are all about user experience: fast, accessible, and personal. Don't focus on all trends, but choose 2-3 that fit your target audience.

## Calculating website ROI: is the investment worth it?

A website costs money. But what does it yield? Learn how to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of your website.

### What is website ROI?

ROI = (Revenue - Costs) / Costs × 100%

Example: Your website costs €1,200/year and generates €6,000 in new customers.
ROI = (6,000 - 1,200) / 1,200 × 100% = **400%**

### Inventory costs

All costs listed:
- Building website (one-time or subscription)
- Hosting and domain
- Maintenance and updates
- Content creation
- Marketing/advertising

### Measuring returns

This is harder, but essential:

**Direct returns:**
- Sales via website
- Paying leads
- Online bookings

**Indirect returns:**
- Leads that become customers later
- Phone calls via website
- Brand awareness

### A realistic example

**Situation:** Freelancer with website subscription

- Website costs: €99/month × 12 = €1,188/year (incl. VAT)
- Net costs after VAT deduction: €952/year
- Average customer value: €500
- New customers via website: 4/year

**Calculation:**
- Revenue: 4 × €500 = €2,000
- ROI: (2,000 - 952) / 952 × 100% = **110%**

With just 4 customers per year, your website is profitable! And as an entrepreneur, you get the VAT back.

### Track your results

To measure ROI you need data:
- Google Analytics (free)
- Call tracking
- Form tracking
- Conversion goals

### Tips for better ROI

1. **Improve conversion**: From 2% to 4% = double revenue
2. **More traffic**: SEO and content marketing
3. **Higher customer value**: Upsells, better services
4. **Lower costs**: Efficient maintenance

### Conclusion

A website is not a cost, but an investment. With the right tracking, you can calculate exactly what it yields. At Webstability, we see that most customers earn back their investment within 6 months.
